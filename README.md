# PartnerLens Copilot: Citation-Audited Partner Pricing & Demographic Intelligence Assistant

## Project Overview

PartnerLens Copilot is a Version 1 baseline Generative AI solution that allows business users to ask natural-language questions about synthetic partner pricing, demographic, and transaction data.

The system converts a user question into SQL, validates the SQL, queries a SQLite database, generates a business-friendly answer, and audits the final response for source-field citations.

## Business Objective

Business users often need quick answers about partner demographics, pricing tiers, transaction growth, and regional distribution. However, this information is usually stored in structured databases that require SQL knowledge.

The objective of this project is to create a controlled Generative AI assistant that improves access to partner intelligence while reducing hallucination risk through SQL validation and citation auditing.

## Dataset Source and Licence

The dataset used in this project is fully synthetic and created for academic capstone purposes. It does not contain real company, partner, customer, pricing, or confidential information.

Licence: Academic use only.

## Current Implementation Status

### Version 1 baseline includes:
      Synthetic partner dataset
      Data dictionary
      SQLite database workflow
      Natural-language-to-SQL baseline design
      SQL validation layer
      Query execution layer
      Business answer generation
      Citation audit logic
      Initial evaluation examples
      Modular repository structure

### Known Limitations
      Dataset is synthetic and smaller than a real enterprise partner database.
      SQL generation currently supports a limited set of question patterns.
      Citation auditing is rule-based in the baseline version.
      Complex multi-step analytical questions may require additional query planning.
      The interface is basic and designed for baseline demonstration.

### Planned Improvements for Final Submission
      Expanded synthetic dataset
      Improved SQL generation
      More advanced SQL validation
      Better citation scoring
      More formal evaluation metrics
      Enhanced Streamlit interface
      Additional unit tests
      Improved error handling for ambiguous questions
